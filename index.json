The effect builds up over time and is long lasting. We develop a New Keynesian model with heterogeneous workers that rationalizes these results. The model shows that expansionary monetary shocks lead to larger increases in the employment of less attached workers when the central bank follows an average inflation targeting rule and when the Phillips curve is flatter.

To this end, the asymptotic properties of recursive, or adaptive, procedures for the removal of general additive deterministic components are analyzed in two different, complementary, situations. When the stochastic component of the examined time series is weakly stationary (as would be the equilibrium errors), the effect of recursive adjustment vanishes with increasing sample size. When the suitably normalized stochastic component converges weakly to some limiting continuous-time process with integrable paths (as would be the case with the common stochastic trends), recursive adjustment has a permanent effect even asymptotically: the normalized recursively adjusted process converges weakly to a recursively adjusted version of the limiting process. The null limiting distributions of the cointegration rank tests can be expressed in terms of recursively adjusted Brownian motions. Moreover, the finite-sample properties of the cointegration rank tests with recursive adjustment are examined in cases of empirical relevance: the considered deterministic components are a constant, and a constant and a linear trend, respectively. Compared to the likelihood ratio tests or the tests with generalized least squares adjustment, improvements in terms of empirical rejection frequencies under the null are found in finite samples; improvements are found under the alternative as well, with the likelihood ratio test performing increasingly better as the magnitude of the initial condition increases. Regarding rank selection, a very simple combination of the three testing procedures with different adjustments performs best.","tags":[],"title":"Recursive Adjustment for General Deterministic Components and Improved Tests for the Cointegration Rank","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Born","Johannes Pfeifer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417392000,"objectID":"35ef3a2736ca32cb118e1dca308b2768","permalink":"https://BenjaminBorn.github.io/publication/bornpfeifer_comment_2014/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T22:11:49+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bornpfeifer_comment_2014/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that the risk-shock business cycle model of Fernández-Villaverde et al.

The 'pure uncertainty' effect of this policy risk is unlikely to play a major role in business cycle fluctuations.

This article asks how such communications affect financial markets, based on a unique dataset covering more than 1,000 releases of Financial Stability Reports (FSRs) and speeches by 37 central banks over the past 14 years. The findings suggest that optimistic FSRs lead to significant and potentially long-lasting positive abnormal stock market returns, whereas no such effect is found for pessimistic FSRs. Speeches and interviews, in contrast, have smaller effects on market returns during tranquil times but have been influential during the 2007–10 global financial crisis.","tags":["select"],"title":"Central Bank Communication on Financial Stability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Born","Alexandra Peter","Johannes Pfeifer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1385856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1385856000,"objectID":"174f38020a5faeecc069086afe0a132f","permalink":"https://BenjaminBorn.github.io/publication/bpp_fiscalnews_2013/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T22:11:49+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bpp_fiscalnews_2013/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper analyzes the contribution of anticipated capital and labor tax shocks to business cycle volatility in an estimated New Keynesian business cycle model. While fiscal policy accounts for about 15% of output variance at business cycle frequencies, this mostly derives from anticipated government spending shocks. Tax shocks, both anticipated and unanticipated, contribute little to the fluctuations of real variables. However, anticipated capital tax shocks do explain a sizable part of inflation fluctuations, accounting for up to 12% of its variance. In line with earlier studies, news shocks in total account for about 50% of output variance. Further decomposing this news effect, we find permanent total factor productivity news shocks to be most important. When looking at the federal level instead of total government, the importance of anticipated tax and spending shocks significantly increases, suggesting that fiscal policy at the subnational level typically counteracts the effects of federal fiscal policy shocks.","tags":[],"title":"Fiscal News and Macroeconomic Volatility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Born","Falko Juessen","Gernot J.

In a second step, we interpret the evidence through the lens of a New Keynesian small open economy model.

This paper argues that central bank communication will play a central role for that purpose, and makes the point that it should be generally geared towards clarity, transparency and predictability, in order to enhance the effectiveness of macroprudential policies and ensure central bank accountability. Moreover, central banks must manage expectations by clearly communicating what macroprudential policy can achieve, and what its limitations are, to counteract reputational risks. This paper also provides empirical evidence showing that financial markets react significantly and systematically to central bank communication about financial stability issues. However, some forms of communication – such as through speeches – may at times raise volatility and uncertainty, in particular during crises, thus underlining the importance of choosing carefully a communication strategy on macroprudential policy which is suited for a given market environment.","tags":[],"title":"Communicating about Macroprudential Supervision - A New Challenge for Central Banks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Born","Gernot J.
